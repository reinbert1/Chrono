## Project goal
_The goal of this project is to develop a chronometer for sprinters. (This can of course be used in other sports)_

One of my hobbies is athletics. As a long distance runner, it is easy to keep track of your lap times during interval training. For sprinters, this is not the case. Due to the starting position, it is not obvious to start the time. To solve this problem I try to create a sprint stick so the sprinter can easily measure his time.
